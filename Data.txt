one very important thing I missed out on is 'do a PhD you love' and where you will learn the most. Money is good, but it is not enough. PhD can be so demanding and requires you to push yourself a lot, mostly beyond current thinking. If you are in a PhD you do not love, you might be miserable. So, kindly go for a PhD you love.

For me, passion first.  Find your passion. Is it money, research, or both. Choose wisely, and be ready to face any implication of your choice. Regardless of any choice, please learn truly, so that it becomes yours.

@Innocent A. M I believe there are scenarios that one should ask to be moved from one team to another. People sometimes can't just get along for various reasons. Especially in a corporate environment, some people tend to be ambitious, even at the cost of others. I have seen first-hand, where some people delegate tasks assigned to them to other members of the team. Why would one have to take all this? In such cases, employees have the right to ask their managers to intervene; Managers have the responsibility to do so.
